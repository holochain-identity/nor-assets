# Holoom happs

Hosted here for the convenience of holo hosts that need to download the happ.

Bundles are named by their hard-coded network seeds (bound by the authority agent, who also determined the dna props).

Special characters occuring in network seeds have been substituted with `_`s to make the filenames into valid paths.
